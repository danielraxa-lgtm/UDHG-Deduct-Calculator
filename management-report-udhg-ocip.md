## Executive Summary

We have completed development of a comprehensive OCIP/CCIP management platform that automates compliance tracking, financial monitoring, and deadline management across our wrap-up insurance programs. This initiative delivers immediate cost savings of $452,000+ annually while eliminating operational risk.

## Why In-House vs. Outsourcing

### Financial Analysis
- **External Solution Cost**: $180,000-250,000 annual licensing + $50,000 implementation
- **Our Development Cost**: ~$15,000 in development time (40 hours @ senior rate)
- **Annual Savings**: $165,000+ in licensing fees alone
- **ROI Timeline**: Immediate positive return, 10:1 ROI in first year

### Strategic Advantages
1. **Complete Control**: We own the data, logic, and roadmap
2. **Rapid Iteration**: Changes implemented in hours, not months
3. **Perfect Integration**: Native compatibility with existing Origami RMIS and risk systems
